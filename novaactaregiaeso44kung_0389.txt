STUDIES IN STELLAR STATISTICS. III. los)

and so also are variables and stai‘s having peculial· spectra. A catu-
logue of these 804 stars is given in the ineinoir, containing the galactic
cooi‘dinates of the stass and also all the inforination that has been
collected regarding them, such as specti‘al class, apparent 1nagnitude‚
pai-allex eto. The distribution of the star>- is graphioally illustrated on
the plates at the end of the meinoir. Stei‘eoscopical images, which will
give a general view of the Galaxy of the B-stars in three dimensione,
are in preparation.

S) Finally the absolute velocity is calculated for those stam foi·
which the proper motione as well as the radial velocities are known.
The discussion of these velocities leads to the result that the velocity
surface of the B-Stars is an ellipsoid of revolution having the small
axis perpendiculai‘ to the XY-plane of the Galaxy. The mean component
velocity in the XY-plane ainounts to l.÷› Sir. and to 1.ss Sir. in the plane
perpendiculal· to it, a result in close agreement with that of GYLLEN-
BERG give-n in Meddelanden Ser. 11 Nm 13.
