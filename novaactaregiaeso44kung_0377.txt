STUDOES IN STELLAR STATISTICS. III. 93

The column under the heading of 71⁰ gives the absolute paral-
lax of the star (and ite mean error) according to Kapteyn and based
on the authority named in the next column. The last column gives
the parallax of the star according to table 16 above.

Taking into account the mean errore· in the observed parallaxes
the agreement with the computed parallaxes is good and may serve
as a support of the valucs of R used in our investigatione.

24. Velocius of the B-stmzs. For those stare„ for which the pro-
per motions and the radi-al velocity are known, the velocity compo-
nents may be calculated. Let u and υ denote the proper motione in
α (multiplied by cos ὃ) and ὃ then we compute the reduced proper
motione with the help of the formulae

u‘=1o0·2¹¹¹a , ω’ = 11¹¹=⁰22=
and the linear velocities perpendicular to the line of sight through
U=Ra', V=R0'.

The three componente U'‘, V and WW in the equatorialsystem
of coordinates are now obtained from the formulae

I have given in table 1 a catalogue of 156 stars with known
radial velocity and proper motione. All stare being brighter than the
5⁸³ magnitude. For these starel 1 have computed the componente of
the velocity in the galactic system through the formulae given above.
The values of UO, VO and W0 are given in the following table

¹ Three stars in table 1 have been excluded because they do not belong to the
subclasses here discussed.
