STUDIES IN STELLAR STATISTIGS. III. 55

The 15⁰¹, 16²h and 17⁶¹ columns give the rectangular galactic
coordinates of the stars, taking the sun as the cenlre of thc system
of coordinates. These values are expressed in Siriometers„ without
decimals. When the values of R are surer known for the different
subclasses (l think especially on the subclass Bo) more accurate values
may be easily deduced from-the values· of Ξ), ηΟ and CO given, wilh 2
decima] places, in the columns 10, ll and 12.

The 18ἰὴ column gives the distance —ro — of 'the star from the
‘sun and the 19⁰² column gives the corresponding parallax computed
with the help of the formula

π = [)'',20626:» ; 1'0 .

The 20t¹¹ column gives the distance ——7·⁰ ω from the centre of
the galaxy and finally in the 21⁸¹, 22⁴¹ and the 23(ἰ columns the galac—
tic coordinates are given referred to the centre as origin.
