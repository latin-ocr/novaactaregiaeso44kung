Plate ΙΙ. The Galaxy of the B-stars as seen from the axis of Z.

This plate gives the projection of the Galaxy of the B-stars on
the XY-plane (= the fundamental plane of the Milky way) according to
the catalogue in table 16. The coordinates are given only to the whole ¹
Siriometer. Consequently there are 31 stars having the same projected

coordinates x, y. Each one of these stars is on the diagram indioated *²
by a single dot.
