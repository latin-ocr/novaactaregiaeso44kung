l. The problem of wave-motion in a ssuid of variable density
was attacked in 1883 by LORD RAYLE1‹T†H¹„ with a view to studying the
stability conditions which, according to HELMHOLTZ'S suggestion, govern
the formation of cirrus clouds. Lord RAYLEIGH considers two otherwise
unlimited tluids of different densities, separated by a horizonta] stratum
whose density, according to a special law of transition„ gradually
changes from one value to thev other. From a more general point of
view. the theory of waves in heterogeneous liquids has been dealt with
by BURNS1DE2 and Low-³.

Lord RAYLEIGH's problem ma)v be described as dealing with the
propagation os waves on a diffused boumlary, and is one which, freed
from restrictions as to special laws of dcnsity-variaticn etc„ is of like
importance to hydrography and meteorology. The following note gives
a general result which is quantitatively interpreted with the practically
well—founded restriction that the waves considered have a small wave—
length compared with the thickness of the layer os density transition.
The result is presented in the forn] ol' a correction to be applied to
Stokes' well-known formula for the velocit)v of propagation oi waves
on a non-diffused boundary.

We may discuss also a moro general problem, including the
above as a special case. by considering two uniform liquids animated
by different horizontal velociticsz Friction and diffusion combined will
cause the ssuids to mix with each other at the surfacc of separation,
and a layer is soon formed in which there is a gradual transition of
