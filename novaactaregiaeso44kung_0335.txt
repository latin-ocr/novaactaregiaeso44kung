(where (ι’, gs, ε ¹dre reekoned fron] the eentre of the Galaxy and are
referred to the three galaetie axes defined in ,ξ 187) is given through
the formula

As to the numerio-<11 values os the three (lispersions (4,, αι, and
“³2 they are easily dedueed from the results of ξ 17. The three roots
of the equatiffl] Ilm = Ο are„ indeed„ according to an well known theo-
rem in the theory of quadratio forms, equal to the reciproca] values
of the equares of the dispersions along the three fundamental axes.
Let λΗ). λθ), λθ) be the three roots of the -Jaeobean eqnation, we thus
have

l : αἶ Ξ λ(“) Ξ W O.000721 ,
l :anss = λῶ Ξ ψ 0.υι)0721 ,

so that

α1 Ξ αἱ, Ξ 3734 ; ((3 Ξ 13ιί9 Sir.
As a eheek to the eomputation we observe that
ula2a3 = ‹710263VS .

Substituting these values into (1⁰) we get

For the B-stars we have N Ξ 751. and hence
O.000003496 N = 0.002625 .

Considering a parallelipipedon in tlle eentre (h. e. ρι’ΞμΞ-εΞΟ),
and having the length ol' the sides equal to one Siriometer we get

η Ξ 0002625 ,
