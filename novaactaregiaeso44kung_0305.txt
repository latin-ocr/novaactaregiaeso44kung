class B 2.

Typical star γ Orionis, and (ι Lupi.

These spectra differ from that of ρ’ Centauri 111 Class 151 principally in the greater
intensity of the lines due to 1161111111, 111 1116 diminished intensity of lines 40892.» and 46492,
and in the absence of line 4116.2.

The lines due to helium appear to reach their maximnm intensity in spectra of this
class. Those having the greatest intensities are at wave lengths 3819.2‚ 4009.5‚ 40264,
4144.ο, 438721, 4471.s‚ and 49221, all of which belong to the first subordinate series ol'
(either) helium (or parhelium).

The characteristic lines of spectra ol' Classes Bo and Βι which arc not (1116 10 1161111111
are faint. 4089oe and 46491 are about 0⁴5 as intense as in Clsss Βι , and 4116.2 is not
seen. Among the fainter lines, 40267.4 and 44814 are noticeable. The line, K, is 20 as
intense as in Class Bi .

Clusa B 3 .

Typical star, α Pavonis.

A marked diminution in the number of Orion lines is noticed. Almost all of the
fainter lines of the spectra of Class B·.› have disappeared, and on plates taken with one prism,
few dark lines are seen, except those dne to hydrogen or helinm.

The helium lines⁷ while of about the same intensity as 111 spectra of Class 132, are
more prominent in this spectrum, (111 account 111 1116 faintness, 01· absence of many other
lines. 46492 15 extremely faint, and is not seen on plates taken with one prism. 40590»
is not present. 41285, 413l.4, and 44811 are more intense than in spectra ol' Class
132. 3926ss is more intense than the line K.

Class Β 5 .

Typical star, Φ Velorum.

The spectrum shows a decided advance towards spectra ot' (ΖΙ-(155 A, in the increased
intensity of the four lines, K, 4128 5, 4131.4, and 4481.4.

The lines of hydrogen are 0-6 as intense as in α Canis Majoris.

The lines of helium are the same as in spectra of Class Ba, but they are less intense.

Almost all the fainter lines characteristic ot' the spectra of classes Bo, Bi, and ΒΖ,
are absent. lt 15 interesting to note that, (111116 three intense lines 40892, 41166, and 46492,
characteristic of Class Bo, 41162 disappears in Class ΒΖ, 40896 111 Class Rs, and 4649.2
in Class B5. They all become very faint 111 1116 class preceding the one in which they are
invisible.

For each one of these subclasses I have determined the value
of R and My considering separately all stars brighter than the 52¹¹
magnitude, those brighter than the δώ but fainter than the 5⁰¹ magni-
tude, and finally all stars brigliter than the (31¹¹ magnitude.
