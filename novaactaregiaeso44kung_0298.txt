14 (Ἰ. Υ. L. (YHARLIER,

Ι have had occasion many times in my studies on stellar statis-
tics to lay stress upon the difference between the mean value of a
quantity x and the inverse value of the mean value of lxx. Especi-
ally there is a great difference between

M({-.)

and lelt·l‚ where r denotes the distance of a star of, say, a cer· ⁴

tain apparent magnitude. (Compare Meddel. N:o 68).
The necessary condition for using the equation

ΜΕ) 2 1 :Mlti

is that the frequency distribution ol' the ¹r-values does not contain such
values of xx„ which are small, that moreover this frequency distribution
is nearly normal of type A, and that the dispersion is small.

These conditions are, evidently, nearly fulfilled for the values
of R, at least as far as the stars ol' type B are concerned. Hence
we are here entitled to put

M(I¹—3)--1:]l[4113›=1:l12.‚ .

Inverting (14) we thus get¹
(15) R„ Ξ 4.762 Sil-iometers

h. e a star of type B placed at a distance of 4762 Siriometers appears
to an observer on the earth as a star ol' the apparent magnitude zero.

The equation (2) gives for the absolute maym'tude (M) l: the
apparent magnitude at a distance of one Siriometer} of a star of spec-
tral type B the value

‹15²⁸› M = - :ruff

somewhat brighter than was concluded in the more summ-ary discus—
sion of Meddel. N:o 68.
