INFL. OF DlFFUsmN oN THE PROPAG. OF BOUNDARY WAVES. 9

Proeeeding to the ease of a gredual ’ω’-(1115111011, our equations

8) and 9) are at once simplified because of our assumption 0131111115-

ition layer of thickness small compared with the wavo-length ἶ.

Since δ 15 appl‘eoiable only within levels y for which lass 15 very small,
it follows that
ky . ‹l‘

is always very small, and that approxhnately

Thus we put the integration variable ,3 equal to zero in an)v exponen—
tial multiplied by ὃ (or ε). Hence S) reduces to:
