and from the proper motions in 15:

U'' Ξ ⁷⁷³ 0.667 R ‚
V'' τ ’“ l.04:. R ,
IV'‘ Ξ ἡ([3ιὸ R .

From the last three formula} we deduce

..2 = l.343 R

henoe nearly the same value as from α and ὃ combined.

9. Brisflzt star-51. From the stars brighter than the 5⁰¹ magni-
tude, on which the value of Ω is based. I have taken out those brighter
then the 4²¹³ magnitude for an independent determination of R. There
are 67 such stars of the spectra] type Β.

The normal equations obtained from their radial velocities have
the form

ll.192 U'' w 5010 V'' ἢ lim W* = -μ 12,76

and
Ω = 4..='›97 Sirssst. y.

in good agreement with the result obtained from all stass brighter
than 5¹³¹.‹·›. I have used the latter value in the eomputation of R beneath.
From the right aseensions 1 obtain
U'' = μ Omni? R ,
