STUDIES ir: STELLAR STA'rls'rics. ΙΙΙ. 53

putations5 since it has been found by GYLLENBERG that the value of
the parameter R for stars of the subclass Oe 5 B —— accidentally —
does not materially deviate from the value of this parameter charac-
terizing stat-s of the subclass Ba. From this reason I have not found
it necessary to make a new computation with those stars excluded.

When I had already tinished the computations reported in 1116
preceding paragraphs Ι found that the Catalogue of PicKERING in H. A.
56 does not contain all stars of type Β recorded in the Annals of the
Harvard observatory. Comparing my catalogue with »The revised
Harvard Photometry catalogue» in H. A. 50. I found 54 stars of the
spectral type B which were not registered in H. A. 56¹. Consequently
l have computed the coordinates of these 54 stars and have inserted
them into the catalogue, which is thus brought up 10 805 numbers„
including the ten stars of the subclass ue ἴ) B, which properly had to
be excluded.

I have not considered it necess-ar)v to recapitulato the computa-
tion of the direction of the principal axes of the Galaxy, taking into
account the 54 stars not included in H. A. 56, nor have Ι corrected
the coordinates of the centro for these stars, though such a correc-
tion could be easily made. The diagrams on plates III—V show that
the orientation of the axes cannot be materially in error and I think
it is imprudent to make successive corrections to the galactic system
of axes defined above. which ma)v 116 used to advantage till the stars
of the spectral type A arc as completer known as now the stars of
the spectral type Β. Α new determination of the princip-al axes ot'
the Galaxy can then be performed with considerable accuracy?

¹ 11 is to 116 regretted that the memoirs in the Harvard Annals are not separately
dated. The presace to HA. ¹5)ss 15 dated oct. 1912, and that to H. A. 50 March 1908,
11111 evidently the memoir on the B-stars in H. A. 5⁴3 is written before the completion of
H. Av 50.

2 1 1611111 from a letter 01“ Μιι· Pam-mma, dated March 21, 1912, that Miss CANNON
is at work on the rcvised Draper Catalogue, which will give 1116 class of spectrum of about
100000 stass. Ι suppose that the greater part of the A-stars wilt be found in this catalogue.
(During the print of this lnemoir l gather from another letter ot' M. Putkssamo that the classi-
[ication ot* the spectra is now practically completed. Miss Canuon has classified the spectra
of about moooo stars. 'l‘he work will till eight volumes of the Annals. 01 11111111 tlw 11151
0116 is nearly completed. A special catalogue af all H stass 15 also planned).
