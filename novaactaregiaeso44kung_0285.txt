r l. In the »Astron Naehrichten» N:o 4801 Ι have remarked
that the distanoes of the stare of the spectral type Β ma)v be deduc-em
for each individual star. from the value of their apparent magnitude. as
soon as the value ot a certain parameter — R — has been determined
from the radial velocities of the stare combined with their known pro-
per motione in right aseension and declination. Ipropose to carry
out here this determination.

2 Let m. be the apparent magnitude of a star and o· its di-
stance from the observer„ then we have between γ and m the relation

(ι) ›— = eid-2112

where R denotes the distance (ct which tlte star in question should have
cm [ιρρανεηί magmz'tucle equal z‘o 0¹¹¹.‹·.

The relation (1) may, in theoreticc‘cl researohes, more conveniently
be written in the form

(1²³) Γ = Rem ,

where

b Ξ O.2 “log lo = O.460517 .

As to the parameter R it is a constant for eaehstar, but varies
from one star to another according to the temperature and the diame-
ters of the stars. Let ρ be the semi-diameter and T the temperature
of a star. then we have

,R Ξ ε’ίιιΤ),

where f1(T) denotes a certain function of the temperature. Hence R
is proportional to the diameter ot' the stars.
