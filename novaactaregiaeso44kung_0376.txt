Ι give on plates 11*li the projection of the Galaxy 01 1110 Β·

stars on the three coordinatc planes. The most distant star —— which
15 not represented on the plates¹ — 15 N:o 612. 11 belongs to the

subclass B1 and has an apparent magnitude equ-al to 7, 0. 115 distance
from the sun ainounts 10 267 Siriometers and its distance from the
centre is 250 Sir. The fainlest star of the spectral type Β recorded
in the Harvard Annals is N:o 591 in the square Εὖ. 11 has the magni-
tude SA, belongs to the subclass Βο and 15 at a distance 01 148 Sirio-
11101015. Though the star N:o 612 15 somewhat brighter its computed
distance is greater„ because the subclass Β1 15 characterized by a
greater luminosity.

All 51015, excepting N:o 012, 110 within a sphere with a radius
of 200 Siriometers having the sun as centre. ln the direction 01 1110
110105 01 the Galaxy the 1011101051 star has a distance 01 78 Sir. and only
7 stars have a z-coordinate exceeding 50 Sir. We have found in ξ 21
that the dispersion in the distribution 01 1110 510115 amounts to 37 Sir.
in the XY-plane of the Galaxy and to 13 Sir. perpendicular 10 11.

We find fron] table 16 that the nearest star of the spectral type
Β 15 1110 star N:o 423q a Eridanus⁷ with a distance 01 only 4 Sir.
(π = O''.0:›1ss). Next to it we find the bright stars in Orion, of which
the three stars in the girdle — δ, ε, ζ -- have a distance 01 about
8 Sir. Owing to the great distances 01 1110 B-stars a direct determi-
nation 01 1110 parallax is extremely difficult and precarious. In the
»List 01 parallax determinations compiled by Prof. I. C. Kapteyn and
D:r H. A. Weersma» published in N:o 24 of the »Publications 01 1110
astronomical laboratory at Groningen» there are in all 6 stars 01 1110
spectral type Β (Bo 10 Βῆ) for which a positive parallax has been
found. These stars are the following ones:
