STUDIES IN STELLAR STATISTICS. 111. 101

In the discussion of these values Ι exclude the star N:o 684
(Square E.) on account of the abnormal large value of ‹Zrl :dt (——9.e
Sin). We now obtain

Mean value of (ΖΓ1 [dt = -ἰ- 035 T 0.15

Denoting the dispersions by a„ and αφ we further obtain
a„ = l.84 ἶ O.11 ,
(ιφ = 159 -j Ono ,

It was to be expected that “w would have been greater than
οιΓ and that approxiniately α,. and α3 (the dispersion of the velocities
perpendicular to the plane of the Milky Way) would have had the
same value. This was probable for theoretica} reasons as well as on
account of the direction of the vertex. I think that such a distribution
of the velocities will result from the discussion of the velocities of the
less hot stars„ though the stars of the spectral type B, perhaps on
account of their large masses and their slow motion, have not yet
reached such a state of equilibrium.
