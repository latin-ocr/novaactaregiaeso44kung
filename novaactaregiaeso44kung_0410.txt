tra of the different subd-asses belonging to the spectral type B. Owing.

yet got an answer to this apply and I therefore take the liberty to
reproduoe here from the Harvard Annals Vol. 28 the plato there given
of the different spectra according to the elassit'ieation used in Harvard.
I have added above the spectra a reference to the prineipal lines οῖ’
