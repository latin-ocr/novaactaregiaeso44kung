The description of these subclasses is given by Ρ1οΚ1111111κ101 and
Miss CANNoN in Vol. XXVIII of the Harvard Annals. I give here a
summary of 11115 description, referring moreover to the 111-(116 at the
end of 11115 volume7 giving the spectrum of ε Orionis„ a specimen ot
1116 spectrum of the subtype Bo which is here reproduced from the
above mentioned volume.

Summam) of the description given bv PICKERtNG (H. A. XXVttt t’. 150 11.)
of the different subclasses ot the spectral type Β.
Class B o .

Typical star: ε Orionis (Compare spectrum reproduced on plate l).

All lines dark. This spectrum is specially characterized by the great intensity of se-
veral of the Orion lines. some of them being so well marked that the hydrogen series 15
1101 readily detected at the first glauce, as may be done in all of the following classes of
the B-stars¹

The most characteristic dark lines in this spectrum are at ware lenglhs 40892,
4116.2 and 4649.=.›. These lines reach a maximum in spectra of this class, and are consi-
derably fainter in spectra of Ctass 131, 464922 is more intense than the 1161111111 11116 4471.ε;
40896 15 as intense as the helium line 1026ss and 41162 15 20 as intense as line 410205,
or 41440, The line 40963 15 fainter than in spectra of Class Oe 5 B. The triplet, 4069.4,
4072», and 40759, recently identified with oxygen, forms a conspicuous gronp near Hd.
The calcium 11116, Κ, 15 better defined than other faint lines. The calcium line, Η, appears
also to be present, although not distinctly separated from the adjacent hydrogen, He. Spectra
of faint stars which are photographed with one prism and do not show the less intense

lines clearly, are recognized as belonging 10 11115 class by the presence of the well marked
lines 408922, 4116.2, and 46492.

Class Bi.

'l'ypical star, ρ’ Centauri.

All lines are dai-k. The number of faint lines 15 greater than in spectra of Class
Bo, but 110116 of the Orion lines have as great intensity with respect 10 1116 hydrogen lines
as 111 that class. By the diminished intensity of lines 4089.2 and 41162, the region os Ηδ
has a slightly different aspect from the same region in spectra of Ctass Bo,

The lines of helium are more intense than in spectra of Class Bo. 4471.s now ex-
ceeds 46493, and 412οὠ exceeds 4116.2‚ in intensity. 41205 and 4144.0 are equally intense.
The Helium line D3‚ wave length 5875.9‚ 15 present⁷ with an intensity O.5 as great as Ηῤ.
408116, 411156, aud 46492 are muss 1655 intense than in spectra ot' (ΣΙ-(155 Βυ. The cal-
cium line, K, 15 faint. The calcium line, H, 15 not seen, and is perhaps eoncealed by 1116
hydrogen line, lle.
