Summary.

11) The essential feature 01 1110 present investigation is that it is
based 011 1110 1’)1(ὶ’1ὐὶ(ἷηαῖ brightness 01 the Stare. Moreover their proper
metiens and radial velocities are taken 11110 consideration as far as these
characteristic-s are known.

21 111 1110 statistieal investigations hitherto made the proper motion
01 a star of„ say, the 6²¹² magnitude is direetly compared with the proper
metiens 01 a star 01 the first magnitude, though the latter eoi-responde
10 a linear motion ten times as great as the linear motion 011110 former
star„ 11 heth stare are supposed 10 possess the same luminosity and
apparent motion.

3) One eonsequenee 01 this treatment is that the resulting mean
values· 01 1110 dist-enicesv and metiens 01 1110 stars are subject 10 great
mean errors and) what is 111010 serious, 5011101111]ομΙ even 10 censider-
able systematie err-ers.

Let us eon‘sider 101· a moment a group of starsq all having the
>same (aljsolntel luminosity. The distance 411 01 each individual star is
determined by 1110 apparent magnitude, 111, and a single parameter,
which we will eall R. We have

't' Ξ H 10⁰st

The parameter R is equal 10 1110 distance 01 a star 01 the appa-
rent magnitude Osi. We may express the same thing by saying that a
star 01 1110 apparent magnitude m. when plaeed at a distance equ-al
10 H, will have an ι(1111)·(110111 magnitude equal 10 Ομν.

The value 01 Ε is evidently 11011110 same 101· all stars. It varies,
