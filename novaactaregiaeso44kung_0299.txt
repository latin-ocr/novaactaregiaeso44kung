STUDms IN STELLAR S'rATis'rws Ill. 15)

8, Fama stem-s. Regarding the stars fainter than the 5⁰¹ magni-
tude the knowledge of the radia! veloeities is sfill ver)v scanty. ln
the catalogue of GYLLENBERG there are only 32 stara of the type B
between the 5⁸¹¹ and the ΘΝ magnitude, with known radial veloeity„
out of 214. l have exaniined the radia] voloeifies of these 32 stars and
found a solar veloeity almost identieal to that found fron] the B-stars
brighter than the ΒΨ magnitude, while on the other hand the coordi-
nates of the Apex come out rather discordant. The oomponents of the

mean veloeity of these 32 stars have the values

ΠΗ = Ἡ Lm ,
V'l Ξ ᾗ 3873 3
W'' = — 121³ ,

all expressed in Siriometers per stell-ar year.
Hence we get

Ω = 4.49s ,

almost the same value (4.488) as from the brighter Stare„ whereas the
values of the componente differ considerably fron] those given in (iol.
Taking into consideration that the values of the eoniponents dedueed
fron] the 32 faint stare have large lnean errors aniounting to about
one Sirionieter per stellar year, there i& however, no reason to aeeept
a systematis: inotion of the faint B-stars in relation to the bright ones,

This being the ease we may dednee the valne of R even fron]
the B-Stars fainter than 5¹¹=.0, with the help of their known proper
motions. Treating then] in the Same manner as lhe brighter stars„ 1
have obtained the following normal equ-atione.

Fron] the proper motions in right ascension we get.
