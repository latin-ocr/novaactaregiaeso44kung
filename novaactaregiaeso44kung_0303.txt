The mean errors in R are difficult to determino. lestimate
them to about O.3 Sirlst. year.

Hence it seems probable that the eorrelation between R and m
is real. It should imply that the more distant stars of the spectral
type B would have a fainter luminosity than the nearer ones. It is
necessary to discuss, somewhat in detail, the bearing of this conclusion.

If all stars of the spectra] type Β do possess the same tempe-

rature and the same radius — as has been hitherto accepted in this
investigation — then the value of R ought to be independent of the

apparent magnitude (m) os the stars. Accepting the conclusion
that R varies with m we are obliged to assume that either the tempe-
rature or the radius (or both) of these stars are dependent on m. The
variability o't the radius would impl)v that the bigger stars would be
more condensed near the centre of the Milky XVay, a conclusion by
no means improbable, which is however in this ease eounterbalaneed
by our assumptIon that the stars of the spectral type B, as far as
they possess the same temperature, ought to have also nearly the
same radius.

We are thus indueed to inspeet more closely the hypothesis of
the equal temperatures of the stars of the speetral type B. Insisting
upon our assumption regarding the close eoi-relation between tempera-
ture and the nature of the spectrum, we have to consider the diffe-
rent kinds of the spectra brought together under the common title
»spectral type B».

It is well known that the Harvard observers, having first intro-
duced the speetral types B. A , F, G etc. by and by found it ne-
cessary to insert between these prineipal types a series of subal-asses,
often a number of ten ᾼ which are however not all represented in
the catalogues. Thus we find in the interval between Β and A the

subelasses
B1, ΒΞἢ 83, ΒΓ), RB, Be.
Of these Βε and Be arc suitably taken together with type A.
The spectra] type Β is thus composed of the following 5 subclasses,
Bo. Bi, B2, Bss, ΒΞ),
Moreover there areq in allq three stars elassified as 134 and Bo*q
which are not here taken into consideration.
