ln the present note we confine onrselves 10 1110 simplest ease when
Uis the same at any depth. Thus in the following treatment we iden-
tify U with Γ, where V is the sought 101· wave-veloeity to be deter-
mined by A) together with the bonnclary-conditions. As for these
boundary-eonditions we obtain cases of meteorologieal interest by sup-
posing the tluid limited by a rigid plane bottom and unlimited upwards
with its density eonverging towards zero, whereas in the hydrographie
ease we have an Upper free suri-aee of zero pressure. It is known
however. from Stokes⁷ laws of boundary wave-motion, that when the
differenees of density involved are small, the vertieal motion of this
upper surfaee is very ineonsiderable. Thus no appreeiable erroris
committed. if we assume the ssuid to 110 1111111011 by horizonta] walls in
both directions„ an arrangement whieh, by taking the upper boundary ”
