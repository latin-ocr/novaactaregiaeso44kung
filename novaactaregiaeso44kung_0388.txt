rica 111 111656 (11511131 times make it, however, unlilzely that an answer
will reach me before this memoir goes to press.

6) The value of R being determined, the position 111 space of
each individua] star of the spectral type B is directly deduccd. It is
found that the B-stars form an well defined clustery which from arela-
tively dense centre gradually grows thinner till a distance of some
200 Siriometers is reached, when no more stars are 10 116 found.

The centre of this cluster⁹ which may be assumed to coincide
with the centre of our stellar universe, is situated in a direction a=7.¹¹⁷‚
15* = — 550.ss in the constellation Carina. It lies in a part of the heaven
which is described by Sir -John HERsoHEL as one of the most beautiful
in the sky. The distance of the centre from the sun amounts to 1802
Sir. The sun 1165 4 Sir. above the XY-plane through the centre.

The distribution of the B-stars follows 3 rather simple law. The
frequency distribution is„ indeed, approximately a normal distribution
of type A. The dispersion in the principal plane (the XY-plane) amounts
10 372 Sir. and is nearly the same in all directions of this plane.
Perpendicularly to it the dispersion amounts to 13.1 Sir. The stellar
universe 131 least that of the B—stars) has an extension nearly three
times 35 great in the plane of the Milky XVay as perpendicularly to it.

The density of the B-stars amounts to O.s=‹t›26 stars per eub.-Sir.
in the 6611116. The limit may be set down as 501116 200 Sir. in the
XY-plane and to some 00 Sir. 111 1116 plane perpendicular to it.

The pole 01 1116 Galaxy, as 131 as it is determined by the B-stars‚
lies 31

(17) a π 121139, d* = ÷28054

not far from the place usually adopted as the pole of the Milky way.

A galactic system of coordinates is introduced, having the Z-axis
directed against the point 417). The X-axis is the projection of the
direction from the 6611116 10 1116 51111 011 1116 galactic XY-plane. Its
spherica] coordinates (as seen from the sun) are

(ι = 20¹³.7.-„ d* = 9417Οώ9,
3 point in the constellation Cygnus.
