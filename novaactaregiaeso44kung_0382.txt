These values give the mean veloeity of the B-stars‚ considering
the sun as being at ress, 01· — with the signs reversed — the velo—
eity of the sun relatively to ‘che stars.

Next the relat1ve moments about the origin were eomputed and
duly eheeked. I got the values

¹''11‘†’ lssm ‚ '¹¹22 ÷ (isos
¹‘'12 — 7259 ‚ ι”23 - 2273

¹''12 -l- 3.923 , ¹''a3 -ἰ- 3.222

where at least one decimalplace too mueh is written down.
Next the momente 123,- about the mean are calculated. We get

1'11 -ὒ- 4.140 , 1‘22 -l- 3.3‹÷3
''x-2 ἡ Ο.661 , ι’23 - 0.033
ι’13 — (13⁶8 , ¹¹33 -4- l,7e5 .
As a eheck we use the formula
Ev'fj = Σινὶ,ι ψ (ml ἥ- ⁹²22 ψ wz3)2

where in the sums τ’] take the values 11, 12, 13, 21, ete.
From vij we get the dispersione

σ1 = νῇ = 2.035 ἶ O.117

σ2 = VJ} = l.834 ἶ 0.105

 

(53 = νῇ = l.329 -g Ome .
Furthermore we get for the eoeffieients of eorrelation the values
7⁴23 = - (10156 -ss- omos
νδ] == - Ο.ι360 -ss- 0.0801
7⁰12 = - O.1771 [l] stowe .

As a eheek we may use the formula

 

σι (72 03 VV-222'312'12 = V1‘2s ²‘³l,¹'1·2 ·
