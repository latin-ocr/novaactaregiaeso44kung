bution of 1110 stars about the Z-axis, 11131 1110 νο100111οε 'of 1110 stars
are symmetrieally distributed about the radius vector. The fact that
1110 (1110011011 of 1110 vertex is nearly perpendiculai· 10 1110 radius vector
of 1110 sun fron] 1110 0011110 seems 10 indicate that the stass have a
preferential motion pew'pendieular lo the radius vector (of 03011 star). For
investigating whether this holds true for 1110 Β-5131Ἠ Ι have eomputed
1110 00111Ρο110111Ξ of 1110 velocity of 03011 star along the radius vector

Let as before ΠΟ, VO and W⁰ (1011010 1110 components of the
velocities of 3 3131Ί referred to 1110 sun. Subtraeting 1110 1110311 values

we 01113111 what could be called 1110 oomponents of 1110 veloeity relatively
10 1110 0011110. We denote them by Usi V⁸ and W, so 11131, using the
results of 1110 preceding ξ,

U'' = U⁰ -ῖ 356 ,
Vs = V⁰ — Lae .‚
W⁶ = 117⁰ss l.21 .

Let ν1 (1011010 1110 projection of 1110 radius vector upon 1110 XY-

Dividing by r, we obtain the componente of the veloeity 01 3
star along 1110 radius vector (inore strictly along 1110 projeetion of the
radius vector in the XY-plane) and perpendicular 10 11. These eom-
