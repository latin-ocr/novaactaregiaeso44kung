STUDIES IN STELLAR STATISTICS. III. 99

The mean errors in σ, show that the obtained differenoe be-
tween the dispersions of the velooities along the X-axis and along the
Y-axis is rather uncertain5 whereas the deviating value of σ3 is well
established.

The mean errors in the eoeffioients of correlation show that
only for rw a value deviating fron] zero is made probable. We may
hence conclude that a slight dissymmetry in the velocity ellipsoid in
the plane of the Milky W'ay is probable though uneertainly determi-
ned¹. It will suffice here to neglect this dissymmetry and put

We find here the result of GYLLENBERG (Meddel. Ser. II N:o 13,
Ρ. 42) confirmed„ that the stars of the speetraltype Β are characterized
by a veloeity ellipsoid having the smallest axis directed against the
pole of the Galaxy and the two axes in the XY-plane nearly of the
same magnitude. GYLLENBERG finds, indeed. also a small differenee
between the mean velocities in the *II-plane and it is interesting to
find that q though the mean errors 111 his investigations are still
greater than ours —his values ver)v closely agree with those found in'
this investigation. His axis of Χ is directed⁷ approximately„ against ’
